# odoo-installation-autometed
Automated interactive bash script for installing Odoo.  This script is based on the installation script of Yenthe V.G (https://github.com/Yenthe666/InstallScript) Inspired by his work I have created similar interactive script for automated Odoo installation on both CentOS and Ubuntu servers.
